                <h3>Swarm Robotics Class at NU</h3>
                <p> 
                    This was a swarm robotics class in which we read various research papers on swarm algorithms, systems and implementations. We learned about localization algorithms, genetic algorithms, flight algorithms, flocking algorithms and many more. We also implemented a few of these algorithms in the Docker environment. Specifically, we designed a hop count algorithm, an algorithm to mimic the brazil nut effect, and and a flocking algorithm.
                    <br><br> See the video below for the Brazil Nut Effect simulation and see the GitHub link for code and more simulations.

                        particle filter experiment using a centralized controller. Continuing from the work of a former grad student, I've worked to enhance the target detect algorithm in the robots, improve the line following algorithm and reduce traffic buildup in the maps through taking sensor readouts to determine where the inefficincies lie in the hardware and software.
