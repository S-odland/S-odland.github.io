            NURC holds a special place in my heart as it was my first real introduction to robotics. I have been on this club for three years now and am currently the Workshop Chair on the execetive board for the club. Battlebots and workshop are my main focuses with NURC. See below to learn about them.

                    <h1>NURC Workshop</h1>
                    <h3>Northwestern University Robotics Club</h3>
                    <p>This was an introductory robotics course I designed for new members of NURC. It covers
                        the basics of embedded programming in C++ in Arduino IDE. In this course we covered PWM, simple
                        circuit design, and embedded programming. The culmination of this workshop was in making a 
                        motion sensor use the knowledge learned throughout the workshop. The motion sensor was made up of an ESP32, 
                        phototransistor, retroreflective tape and a laser. 
                        <br><br> If you'd like to see the contents of the workshop see the wiki section of the GitHub link below.

                    <h1>BattleBots</h1>
                    <h3>NURC Project for Robobrawl Competition</h3>
                    <p> An annual competition held at UIC, we built a 30 lb. drumbot to compete against other
                        30 lb. battlebots. The robot was designed in OnShape and made out of 
                        aluminum and steel parts. Over 30 hours was put into machining the robot and around 5-10 hours 
                        was spend programming the differential drive. We had to map the movements of a joystick to the drive
                        of the robot.
                        <br><br> See the videos below for a video of the battlebot moving and the weapon spinning up!
