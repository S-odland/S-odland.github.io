                I've taken various mechatronics orojects in and out of college and am continuing to do so so that I can reaffirm and solidify my knowledge in and understanding of mechatronics. See below for descriptions of the projects in these courses and the content learned in each!

                <h1>Quadcopter Flight Control</h1>
                <h3>Independant Project Started at NU and Continued After Graduation</h3>
                <p>This project was started in the spring quarter of my senior year at NU. For it I was tasked with
                   designing the flight control software for a quadcopter to achieve stable hovering within a testing setup.
                   To do this I created a UI using a websockets server hosted through a soft access point created using an ESP32 microcontroller,
                   used a LSM6DS33 6-axis IMU to detect tilt of the drone, performed sensor filtering & fusion on the raw IMU data, sent 
                   the filtered data to a PID controller, and devised a testing setup in which to test the full flight control algorithm.
                   <br><br>In its current state, the drone can, within an error of roughly 0.8 radians and for 5 to 10 seconds durations
                   maintain a commanded angle. For future work I will design a higher fideility testing setup as well as look to further smooth and reduce lag of the tilt data from the IMU.
                   This status can be seen in the videos, images and github link below.

                <h3>Mechatronics Courses at NU</h3>
                <p>This spans two mechatronics courses at NU, in which we use a PIC32 microcontroller to learn how to 
                    communicate between sensors (I2C, SPI), wire up those sensors at make valuable uses of them. For the 
                    introductory course, the culmination was in the form of a PID motor control project in which was had a 
                    motor go to various angles along a trajectory. In the Advanced course, we just experimented with various
                    electrical components such as an OLED display and accelerometer. 
                    <br><br> If you'd like to see the code for either of these course see the two GitHub links below (left is intro, right is advanced).
                    And if you'd like to see the PID control in action see the video below.

                <h3>A Webcam Design Project at NU</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a continuation in my mechatronics education in the form of building a webcam using a SAM microcontroller, Zentri wifi chip and an OV7740 camera and programming these components in C with Microchip Studio. My partner and I designed a PCB to be printed, built a website to display the camera image to and are in the processing of designed a housing for the PCB.<br><br>
                    
                    Unfortinuately due to Covid, we never got to assemble the final components of the webcam, but see below for the PCB design and CAD model<br>
