                I've taken various mechatronics courses at NU and am continuing to do so so that I can reaffirm and solidify my knowledge in and understanding of mechatronics. See below for descriptions of the projects in these courses and the content learned in each!

                <h3>Mechatronics Courses at NU</h3>
                <p>This spans two mechatronics course at NU, in which we use a PIC32 microcontroller to learn how to 
                    communicate between sensors (I2C, SPI), wire up those sensors at make valuable uses of them. For the 
                    introductory course, the culmination was in the form of a PID motor control project in which was had a 
                    motor go to various angles along a trajectory. In the Advanced course, we just experimented with various
                    electrical components such as an OLED display and accelerometer. 
                    <br><br> If you'd like to see the code for either of these course see the two GitHub links below (left is intro, right is advanced).
                    And if you'd like to see the PID control in action see the video below.

                <h3>A Webcam Design Project at NU</h3>
                <p>This is a continuation in my mechatronics education in the form of building a webcam using a SAM microcontroller, Zentri wifi chip and an OV7740 camera and programming these components in C with Microchip Studio. My partner and I design a PCB to be printing, built a website to display the camera image to and are in the processing of designing a housing for the PCB.<br><br>
                    See Below for the PCB board design. More content to come as the course comes to an end!
