                    <h3>Swarm Robotics Class at NU</h3>
                    <p> This was a swarm robotics class in which we read various research papers 
                        on swarm algorithms, systems and implementations. We learned about localization algorithms, genetic algorithms, 
                        flight algorithms, flocking algorithms and many more. We also implemented a few of these algorithms in the Docker 
                        environment. Specifically, we designed a hop count algorithm, an algorithm to mimic the brazil nut effect, and 
                        and a flocking algorithm.
                        <br> See the YouTube link below for the flocking simulation and see the GitHub link for code and more simulations

                    <h3>Introductory Robotic Manipulation Course at NU</h3>
                    <p>This was an introductory course in Robotic Manipulation culminating in a 
                        final capstone project where I was tasked with having a YouBot (UR5 arm 
                        attached to an omnidirectional base) solve a simple pick and place problem.
                        In this course I learned Feedforward and PID control for robotic arms and bases,
                        using various linear algebraic properties to solve these tasks as the number of
                        components scaled up. 
                        <br> If you'd like to see the results of this capstone or the code that made it work,

                        from the work of a former grad student, I've worked to enhance the target

                        during experimentation. 
                        <br> Current experiments function with nine robots. In the future we are 
                        looking to expand this to 30 robots so stay tuned. Follow the GitHub link

                    <h3>Northwestern University Robotics Club</h3>
                    <p>This was an introductory robotics course I designed for new members of NURC. It covers
                        the basics of embedded programming in C++ in Arduino IDE. In this course we covered PWM, simple
                        circuit design, and embedded programming. The culmination of this workshop was in making a 
                        motion sensor use the knowledge learned throughout the workshop. The motion sensor was made up of an ESP32, 
                        phototransistor, retroreflective tape and a laser. 
                        <br> If you'd like to see the contents of the workshop see the wiki section of the GitHub link below.

                    <h3>NURC Project for Robobrawl Competition</h3>
                    <p> An annual competition held at UIC, we built a 30 lb. drumbot to compete against other
                        30 lb. battlebots. The robot was designed in OnShape (an online CAD platform) and made out of 
                        aluminum and steel parts. Over 30 hours was put into machining the robot and around 5-10 hours 
                        was spend programming the differential drive. We had to map the movements of a joystick to the drive
                        of the robot.
                        <br> Follow the youtube links below for a video of the battlebot moving and the weapon spinning up!

                    <p>This spans two mechatronics course at NU, in which we use a PIC32 microcontroller to learn how to 
                        communicate between sensors (I2C, SPI), wire up those sensors at make valuable uses of them. For the 
                        introductory course, the culmination was in the form of a PID motor control project in which was had a 
                        motor go to various angles along its trajectory. In the Advanced course, was just experimented with various
                        electrical components such as an OLED display and accelerometer. 
                        <br> If you'd like to see the code for either of these course see the two GitHub links below (left is intro, right is advanced).
