                <br>I'm a senior at Northwestern University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a 
                concentration in robotics. I love to innovate, iterate and see my work in action. 
                I have experience in robotic manipulation, simulation, automation and control. I've 
                worked in Code Composer Studio, MPLAB Harmony and Arduino IDE for various embedded 
                projects ranging from BattleBots to semi-autonomous robots to swarm robots to motion 
                sensors. 
                <br>
                <br>I'm proficient in the following languages: <b>Python, C, C++, CSS, HTML, Racket, MATLAB</b>
                <br>
                <br>If you'd look to see my work continue reading below, I hope you enjoy reading and learning
                about these projects as much as I had actually creating them!

                    <h3>Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Lab</h3>
                    <p> A swarm robotics experiment intended to mimic a bayesian
                        particle filter experiment using a centralized controller. Continuing
                        from the work of a former grad student, I've worked to enhance the target
                        detect algorithm in the robots and to reduce traffic buildup in the maps 
                        during experimentation. 
                        <br> Current experiments function with nine robots. In the future we are 
                        looking to expand this to 30 robots so stay tuned. Follow the GitHub link

                    <h1>Robotic Manipulation</h1>
                    <h3>Introductory Robotic Manipulation Course at NU</h3>
                    <p>This was an introductory course in Robotic Manipulation culminating in a 
                        final capstone project where I was tasked with having a YouBot (UR5 arm 
                        attached to an omnidirectional base) solve a simple pick and place problem.
                        In this course I learned Feedforward and PID control for robotic arms and bases,
                        using various linear algebraic properties to solve these tasks as the number of
                        components scaled up. 
                        <br> If you'd like to see the results of this capstone or the code that made it work, 
                        follow the GitHube and YouTube links below.
