                <br>
                I have just recently graduated from Northwestern University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and a concentration in Robotics. I am focused on a 
                career designing and building robotic systems that leverage human ingenuity and push the frontier of whatâ€™s technologically possible to make the world a better place. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I have dedicated the last four years to learn to design, build and test robotic systems. I have created flight control software for a quadcopter, designed and manufactured 
                robot chasses, and created a pick and place algorithm for a robotic arm in a conveying line. Additionally, I  have learned to appreciate that the best solutions require that 
                engineers innovate, iterate and collaborate with others, across disciplines and expertise. It is my hope that guided by learned experiences, surround with the brightest people, 
                I will contribute to the intelligent pursuit of robotic systems to improve the quality of life for all people.
                <br>
                <br>I am proficient in the following softwares: <b>Python, C, C++, SolidWorks, Onshape, CSS, HTML, MATLAB, Eagle PCB Design</b>
                <br>
                <br>And I have the following skills/am procifient with the following machinery: <b>Manual Mill/Lathe, Conversational Mill, Waterjet, 3D Printer, Object Oriented Programming, Embedding Programming, Laser Cutter, Rapid Prototyping, PID control</b>
                <br>
                <br>I enjoy seeing the low-level functionally of anything I or others create. Ever since I was a kid
                    I have been the handy man of the house, whether that be putting together IKEA furniture or building 
                    my own surf and skateboards. I love the thrill of surfing and serenity of exploring my creative 
                    side through painting. If you'd like to see my engineering projects, take a look at the projects section!

                <div class="question">What was your favorite hobby growing up?</div>
                <br> I loved to draw and paint and get creative in any way possible. My dad always drew cartoons (he got that from his mom) and my great grandmother was a studio artist so I had all these people around me that pushed me to explore my creative side all throughout my childhood.
                <br>
                <br><div class="question">What was your first engineering project?</div>
                <br>I believe my first engineering project were these two modular car sets that you would build up and watch run. There was only and on/off switch so they could only move in one direction, but I remember getting such a joy out of watching them go. That joy in seeing my work come to life still persists today.
                <br>
                <br> <div class="question">What was your favorite project you worked on in College?</div>
                <br> Battlebots. That was the first project at Northwestern that I did where it was completely directed by my team members and I. It's when I first started to feel like a competent engineer as I took lead on manufacturing and ended up creating a pretty cool robot. See the projects section (under NURC) for more about Jaun (our battlebot)!!
                <br>
                <br> <div class="question">What was your favorite class you took in College?</div>
                <br> Painting. I've taken some pretty cool engineering courses throughout my time in college, but taking a painting course amidst the sea of engineering courses was so relaxing. It was an incredible way to excersize the right side of my brain and de-stress each week.
                <br>
                <br><div class="question">What was your favorite project from an internship or job you had?</div>
                <br> The summers after my freshman and sophomore years in college I worked at a woodshop in long island called Grain Surfboards. By the end of my time there, I was running skateboard workshops where I would teach kids and adults to build their own wooden skateboards. From this I made a 'Build-it-yourself' Manual so that people could learn to build skateboards at home. There are two reasons why this was my favorite project. The first is that I loved seeing the kids faces during the whole process; the focus and the excitement was just so contagious. The second is that the skills I learned allowed me to build a custom cutting board for my mom. I made it around 2 and a half years ago and that thing is still getting a lot of use today.
                <br>
                <br><div class="question">How did you get into robotics?</div>
                <br> In the fall of my sophomore year, I was buddies with the then workshop chair of NURC and he persuaded me to try out the workshop. We worked with neopixel leds and ESP32s. I was hooked immediatly and there was no going back.
