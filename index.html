        <p>I am a fourth year student at Northwestern University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering
            with a concentration in robotics. When not focusing on school work, I am likely working on a robot for the Northwestern
            University Robotics Club (NURC). And when not working with robots, you can catch me making excuses to get in the water
            to swim, surf, wakeboard, you name it. I also love to express my creativity and have a nice stress reliever through 
            drawing or painting in my free time.
