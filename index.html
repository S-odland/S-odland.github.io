        <p>I am a fourth year student at Northwestern University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering
            with a concentration in robotics. When not focusing on school work, I am likely working on a robot for the Northwestern
            University Robotics Club (NURC). And when not working with robots, you can catch me making excuses to get in the water
            to swim, surf, wakeboard, you name it. I also love to express my creativity and have a nice stress reliever through 
            drawing or painting in my free time.

        <p> I am currently working on two project. The first is reviving an old robot that burnt out and the second is creating
            a beginners course in robotics for new NURC members. I will be actively updating this component of my website to 
            match the progress of these projects.
