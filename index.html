                <br>I'm a senior at Northwestern University majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a 
                concentration in robotics. I love to innovate, iterate and see my work in action. 
                I have experience in robotic manipulation, simulation, automation and control. I've 
                worked in Code Composer Studio, MPLAB Harmony and Arduino IDE for various embedded 
                projects ranging from BattleBots to semi-autonomous robots to swarm robots to motion 
                sensors. 
                <br>
                <br>I'm proficient in the following languages: <b>Python, C, C++, CSS, HTML, Racket, MATLAB</b>
                <br>
                <br>If you'd look to see my work continue reading below, I hope you enjoy reading and learning
                about these projects as much as I had actually creating them!
