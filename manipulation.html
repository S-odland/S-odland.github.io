            The content of this page come froms my introduction to robotic manipulation. Since learning these concepts I have used them in forming educated opionions about robotic arm conveying processes (the topic of my current internship!).

                    <h3>Introductory Robotic Manipulation Course at NU</h3>
                    <p>This was an introductory course in Robotic Manipulation culminating in a 
                        final capstone project where I was tasked with having a YouBot (UR5 arm 
                        attached to an omnidirectional base) solve a simple pick and place problem.
                        In this course I learned Feedforward and PID control for robotic arms and bases,
                        using various linear algebraic properties to solve these tasks as the number of
                        components scaled up. 
                        <br><br> If you'd like to see the results of this capstone or the code that made it work, 
                        follow the GitHub link and see the video below.
